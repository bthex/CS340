Client/Server Development

1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

When writing programs I try to split each method into a "mini" project. This includes a small planning session, pseudo code, writing of the code, and finally the testing. This allows me to complete a method completely before moving on. While writing the code I try to make all method and parameter names something that is relevant to the method function to allow easy understanding if I come back to it later.

2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

When working with problems I try to step back and view the problem from more than one angle. I had an issue with getting the pie chart and the map both loaded and aligned the way that I wanted to. I started with the CSS because I have the least amount of experience with it and assumed I did something incorrectly like placing them on top of each other. The issue ended up being the "id" for the pie chart. I was using two separate names so the html.Div was loading something that didn't exist. While starting with the code that I have the least experience with may be more time-consuming I believe the system works for me. It also allows me to reread through the code and catch any errors that might cause issues in the future.

3. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer Scientists attempt to create solutions for companies, customers, or themselves for problems that are time-consuming to do manually. For example, the project for Grazioso Salvare would reduce the amount of man-hours it would take to look through animal shelters in the area to find a specific dog. The dashboard allows the company to narrow down its search to a handful of animals and locations in a few seconds instead of having to call multiple animal shelters or sift through documents by hand.
